        As I learn more data visualization and coding skills, I have been compelled to combine new abilities with already existing interests in illustrative-based visuals. Projects listed here have less immediate journalistic applications but are things I enjoy and act as practice for hard skills.

<p class="article-content">
    ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet.
</p>

<p class="article-content">
    In the early days of the internet, ASCII art became a creative medium where artists used characters from the ASCII standard to craft images and animations. This art form relied on the limited set of characters available in ASCII to create intricate designs, often shared in online forums and through email newsletters.
</p>

<p class="article-content">
    This is an art style that I am very partial to and I wanted to create an app that would allow me to insert it into a web development project. I converted the individual frames of the gif into text files and then animated them using JavaScript.
